# Pseudo-code for running haplotree comparisons

# -------------------------------------------
# ! This code does not work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# ! It's not even written properly in Python!
# ! It's not even real code!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# -------------------------------------------

# This pseudo-code is just programmatic doodlings, but it roughly describes how a haplotree can be sorted from input data

# INHERITANCE FROM WORK PACKAGE A
# How this process works depends strongly on the setup acquired from Work Package A. We assume we have:
# (1) Parsed VCF calls into an Calls SQL table, Variants SQL table
# (2) Identified and called all shared variants (and perhaps singletons) among all the VCF files and, where no call exists, checked whether callable coverage in the BED file implies they are negative.
# (3) Obtained quality information from the VCF for each of these calls, such that we know which are passed and which have failed.
# (4) Obtained a reference mutation list, correcting reference positives, so we know which alleles are ancestral and which are derived.
# We will assume we are only dealing with sequencing tests for the time being, that reference calls can clearly be identified from uncalled base pairs, and that there are not large orders of magnitude difference in coverage.

# We will assume that the calls are stored with a ruleID as integer, defined as:
#	 7	Positive	Call=PASS, genotype=1/1 (or 0/0 if a ref pos)
#	 6	Mixed	Call=PASS, genotype=0/1
#	 5	Positive?	Call=FAIL, genotype=1/1 (0/0)
#	 4	Mixed?	Call=FAIL, genotype=0/1
#	 3	Negative?	Call=FAIL, genotype=0/0 (1/1)
#	 2	Negative*	No call, but covered in one of the BED file ranges, not a reference positive
#	 1	Negative	Call=PASS, genotype=0/0 (or 1/1 if a ref pos)
#	 0	Uncalled	No call, no BED file coverage
# Additional codes may be needed to encode quality information (e.g. FGC *,**,*** quality thresholds). We can then sort and process this array to form the haplotree.
# Numbers can be added to this call bitwise. We assume:
#	16 = junk;
#	32 = negative;
#	48 = positive; 
# such that VALUE%16 will give the original and int(VALUE/16) will give the overlain assignment.
# We will need a sort index and statistics for both people and variants.
# We can assume that we will need to process ~5000 people with ~30,000 variants needing investigation (out of ~12 million variants), hence ~150 million calls in total.
# Likely extrema for this analysis would be ~50000 people with ~100,000 variants needing investigation (out of ~23 million variants), hence ~5 billion calls in total.
